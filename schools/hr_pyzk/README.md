You can also get it from  [here](https://github.com/fananimi/pyzk). To install the library go to pyzk_master folder and run python setup.py.</span>

> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Please Visit the image folder in the main folder of the module (hr_pyzk/images) to view different processes.</span>

1.  <span style="color: #000000;">**Make sure you copy the module in addons folder of odoo**. After the installation of the module make sure to make the user member of **"Device/Manager" Security group.**</span>
2.  <span style="color: #000000;">Create attendance devices. Please make sure password is defined on the machine.I think default password is nothing but I am not sure.If device status is defined Inactive the users and attendances will not be imported from it.</span>
3.  <span style="color: #000000;">After defining the device import device users using "User/Attendance Wizard".</span>
4.  <span style="color: #000000;">Define related odoo employees for device users. If Odoo employees are not defined the attendance will not be transferred.</span>
5.  <span style="color: #000000;">Import attendance from the device using "User/Attendance Wizard". Their are separate records for clock ins and clockouts for all users from all devices.</span>
6.  <span style="color: #000000;">Combine attendance using "User/Attendance Wizard". combining means relevant clocin and clock outs will be joined for each user. the logic work as follows.  
    The system makes pairs between subsequent Clock in /clock out. If a user forget clocking out the system will look for the next clock out and ignore a repeating clock in even if it is legal.</span>
7.  <span style="color: #000000;">Transfer attendance to HR Attendance using "User/Attendance Wizard".</span>
8.  <span style="color: #000000;">Delete Attendance from selected device. Be carefull.</span>
